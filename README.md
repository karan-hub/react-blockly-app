This project integrates Blockly into a React application, allowing users to visually construct JavaScript code by dragging and connecting blocks. Custom blocks have been defined for variables, logic comparisons, and math operations, offering flexibility in building simple programs.

## Features

- Blockly integration in a React application
- Custom-defined blocks for:
  - Logic (`if` blocks, comparisons)
  - Variables (`set` and `get` variable blocks)
  - Math operations (addition, numbers)
- Real-time JavaScript code generation from the blocks
- Easy-to-use interface with drag-and-drop functionality
